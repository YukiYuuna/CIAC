В рамките на това ключово действие се осъществяват дейности, насочени към постигане на приоритетите на програмата и генериране на дълготрайни положителни въздействия. Очаква се, че резултатите от този процес ще доведат до разработване, прехвърляне и внедряване на иновативни практики на различни равнища, включително организационно, местно, регионално, национално и европейско равнище.\nПроектът се насочва към насърчаване на активното участие на младите хора в демократичния и гражданския живот в Европа. Чрез създаване на иновативни продукти, включително анализ и доклади за младежката ангажираност, методология за изследване на младежката ангажираност, наръчник с насоки и електронни модули за обучение, проектът се стреми да задълбочи и разшири политическото и социално участие на младежите от местно до европейско ниво. Целевата аудитория включва младежи на възраст 15-29 години, младежки работници, учители и обучители от неформалния сектор.\nИновативното допълнение към нашата обучителна платформа е интеграцията на чатбота ChatGPT, разработен от OpenAI. Този изключително мощен инструмент предоставя нови възможности и представлява истинска революция в света на информационните технологии.\nChatGPT е наистина популярен сред младите хора и стана част от тяхното ежедневие. Интегрирането му в нашата обучителна платформа има за цел да предостави на младежите възможността да го използват за бърз достъп до информация свързана с гражданската активност, гражданските им права или участие в обществени инициативи,\nПроектът насърчава гражданската ангажираност и сътрудничество, като поставя младежите в центъра на демократичния процес. Разработените електронни модули за обучение, в комбинация с Чатбота ще им предоставят актуална информация и подкрепа по всички тези важни теми."

    "content": "Резюме: Проектът се вписва в специфичните приоритети на младежкия сектор и насочва усилията си към предоставяне на средства за по-активното участие на младите хора в демократичния и гражданския живот в Европа. Същевременно се стреми да разшири и задълбочи политическото и социалното участие на младежите на различни нива - местно, национално и европейско.\nОсновната цел на проекта е да насърчи активното гражданство сред младите хора чрез създаване на иновативни интелектуални продукти. Тези продукти включват:\n1. Анализи и доклади относно ангажираността на младите хора в България и Словения;\n2. Методология за изследване на ангажираността на младежите;\n3. Наръчник с насоки, насочен към младежки работници за създаване на ангажираност сред младите;\n4. Електронни обучителни модули, насочени към обучение и участие за младежите.\nОнлайн платформата може да бъде разгледана като \"пространство за съдействие\" - място, където младите хора могат да изследват и развиват собствените си идеи, и да научат как да се превърнат в ефективни участници в тези процеси.\nНа политическо ниво се наблюдава нарастващ спад на интерес и имаме достатъчно доказателства, че младите хора се отдалечават от традиционните форми на демократично участие. Увеличаващата се апатия към гласуване и намаляващото членство на млади хора в политически партии илюстрират този тенденция. Младежите се насочват към \"алтернативни\" или \"иновативни\" форми на участие, които заместват традиционните.\nУчастието на младежите в процесите на вземане на решения, независимо дали те са политически, граждански или други, насърчава активното гражданство, подобрява тяхната интеграция и укрепва техния принос към развитието на демократичното общество. Поради това е от съществено значение да се насърчи това участие."

Поощряване на лицата, вземащи решения, да бъдат по-открити към участието на младежите;\n5. Обучение на образователни и младежки работници в официални и неформални среди и по разнообразни подходи да стимулират участието на младежите, като се подчертава важността на младите хора, които могат да се ангажират и да научат за демократичното вземане на решения още от ранна възраст."
