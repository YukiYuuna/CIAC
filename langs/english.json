The target audience includes young people aged 15-29, youth workers, teachers, and trainers from the informal sector.\nThe innovative addition to our training platform is the integration of the ChatGPT chatbot, developed by OpenAI. This powerful tool provides new possibilities and represents a true revolution in information technology.ChatGPT is extremely popular among young people and has become part of their daily lives. Its integration into our training platform aims to allow young people to use it for quick access to information related to civic activity, their civil rights, or participation in public initiatives.\nThe project promotes civic engagement and cooperation by placing young people at the center of the democratic process. The developed e-learning modules and the chatbot will provide them with up-to-date information and support on all these important topics."

    "content": "Summary: The project aligns with the specific priorities of the youth sector, directing its efforts towards providing resources for the more active participation of young people in democratic and civic life in Europe. Simultaneously, it aims to broaden and deepen youth's political and social involvement at various levels—local, national, and European.\nThe project's main goal is to encourage active citizenship among young people by creating innovative intellectual products. These products include:\n1. Analyses and reports on the engagement of young people in Bulgaria and Slovenia;\n2. Methodology for studying youth engagement;\n3. Handbook with guidelines aimed at youth workers to create engagement among the youth;\n4. Online educational modules focused on training and participation for youth.\nThe online platform can be seen as acollaborationspacewhere young people can explore and develop their ideas and learn how to become effective participants in these processes.\nAt the political level. There is a growing decline in interest, and there is ample evidence that young people are distancing themselves from traditional forms of democratic participation. Increasing apathy towards voting and decreasing membership of young people in political parties illustrate this trend. Youth are turning towards alternative or innovative forms of participation that replace traditional ones.Youth participation in decision-making processes, whether political, civic, or otherwise, promotes active citizenship, improves their integration, and strengthens their contribution to the development of democratic society. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage this participation."
